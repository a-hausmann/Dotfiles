Directory "Dotfiles" is a Git-managed directory to contain all personal dotfiles.
Other files (not dotfiles) may also be maintained in this directory.

The common attribute of all the files in this directory is that they need to be
under version control and the original files are replaced by symlinks pointing
to the files in this directory/repository.
